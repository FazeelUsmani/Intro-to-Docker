# Intro-to-Docker

This repository contains my Docker learning journey. This is not only of DevOps guys, it's especially for developers out there.

* I believe both Docker and Kubernetes are essential for developers because you'll learn how to containerize application using Docker. Kubernetes is used for orchestation and more importantly, as a dev you must know where your code is running.
